# Stress Detection Using Empatica E4 and Hexoskin Biosignals

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a scalable **stress detection model** that integrates biosignals from the **Empatica E4** and **Hexoskin** wearable devices. Unlike existing methods, which primarily focus on individual-level detection, our approach is designed to scale for **team task training simulators**. These simulators aim to identify stress and fatigue-related performance issues during critical tasks, such as procedural compliance in military or high-stakes environments.

By leveraging **tinygrad**, we aim to build a computationally efficient stress detection pipeline that can:
1. Scale to monitor entire teams in real-time.
2. Identify specific moments of procedural deviation (e.g., when fatigue or stress compromises performance).
3. Incorporate long-term baselines to flag serious mental health concerns (e.g., burnout or suicide risk).

## Project Goals

1. **Signal Integration**: Combine biosignals from Empatica E4 (e.g., EDA, PPG, IBI) and Hexoskin (e.g., respiration, ECG) into a unified stress detection model.
2. **Team-Based Scalability**: Develop a pipeline capable of monitoring multiple users simultaneously during task training.
3. **Procedural Compliance Detection**: Pinpoint deviations from expected behavior due to stress, fatigue, or mental health deterioration.
4. **Long-Term Monitoring**: Integrate baseline data to track individuals over time and flag significant deviations.

## Current Methods and Limitations

### Existing Approaches

1. **Single-User Stress Detection**:
   - Primarily focused on detecting stress at an individual level in controlled lab environments.
   - Methods like heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, skin conductance levels (SCL), and respiratory patterns are commonly used.
   - Tools like the **Empatica Research Suite** and **Hexoskin SDK** provide raw data but lack integrated stress models or real-time analytics.

2. **Team-Based Monitoring**:
   - Limited computational resources make scaling for multiple users challenging.
   - Systems like **TeamSense** focus on basic physiological aggregation (e.g., average HRV) without detailed individual or task-specific insights.

3. **Procedural Compliance Systems**:
   - Relies on manual observations or post-task analysis, which are time-intensive and prone to bias.
   - Rarely integrates physiological data, missing the connection between stress and deviations in performance.

### Shortcomings in Biosignal Analysis Theory for Stress/Arousal

1. **Generalization**:
   - Current models often assume universal physiological responses to stress (e.g., increased heart rate or skin conductance). 
   - Stress responses vary significantly across individuals due to factors like fitness, mental health, and context, making one-size-fits-all models unreliable.

2. **Contextual Sensitivity**:
   - Biosignals alone cannot differentiate between physical exertion and psychological stress. For example, an elevated heart rate may result from running or anxiety.

3. **Temporal Dynamics**:
   - Most models analyze signals in static time windows, missing the importance of long-term trends and baseline shifts.

4. **Signal Interference**:
   - Biosignals are highly susceptible to artifacts (e.g., motion, environmental noise). Current preprocessing methods often discard valuable data to ensure "clean" signals.

5. **Lack of Task-Specific Models**:
   - Stress levels vary depending on task difficulty, cognitive load, and team interactions. Current approaches rarely incorporate task-specific baselines or interdependencies.

6. **Scalability**:
   - Current models do not address the complexity of real-time team-based analysis, where multiple individuals must be monitored simultaneously.

## How Our Approach Differs

1. **Scalability**:
   - Lightweight **tinygrad** models optimized for simultaneous monitoring of multiple team members.
   - Efficient signal synchronization ensures real-time processing.

2. **Procedural Compliance Detection**:
   - Automatically flags deviations during task execution (e.g., skipping steps in high-stress scenarios).
   - Links biosignal metrics (e.g., high HRV, irregular breathing) to specific moments of non-compliance.

3. **Baseline Comparisons**:
   - Incorporates individual baselines to assess relative stress levels.
   - Tracks changes over time to flag fatigue, burnout, or mental health deterioration.

4. **Psychological Safety Monitoring**:
   - Models long-term trends to identify sailors or team members at risk of mental health crises.
   - Combines subjective inputs ("Iâ€™m fine") with objective physiological data to override potential bias.

## Workflow

### 1. Biosignal Acquisition
   - **Empatica E4**: Collect signals such as:
     - **EDA (Electrodermal Activity)**: Skin conductance levels.
     - **PPG (Photoplethysmography)**: Pulse rate variability.
     - **IBI (Inter-Beat Interval)**: Heart rate variability.
   - **Hexoskin**: Collect signals such as:
     - **ECG (Electrocardiogram)**: R-peak intervals for HRV.
     - **Respiration**: Breathing rate and tidal volume.

### 2. Signal Synchronization
   - Align Empatica E4 and Hexoskin signals using timestamps.
   - Segment signals by task markers (e.g., "easy," "baseline," "matb hard").

### 3. Feature Extraction
   - Extract stress-relevant metrics (e.g., HRV, SCL, PRV) for each segment.
   - Compute task-specific baselines.

### 4. Model Development
   - Use **tinygrad** to train a neural network that:
     - Learns latent representations of biosignals.
     - Incorporates Bayesian uncertainty for robust predictions.

### 5. Team-Based Stress Analysis
   - Monitor stress levels for each team member during training.
   - Aggregate data to detect task-level stress trends and procedural compliance issues.

### 6. Long-Term Monitoring
   - Compare individual baselines over weeks/months.
   - Flag sailors in the "red zone" based on cumulative stress and deviations from their baseline.

## Potential Applications

   - Identify sailors who may underperform due to fatigue or high stress.
   - Pinpoint procedural compliance failures caused by physiological deterioration.

### 2. Crisis Management
   - Monitor teams in high-stakes scenarios (e.g., nuclear reactor control, combat operations).
   - Provide real-time feedback to supervisors on team stress levels.

### 3. Mental Health Intervention
   - Flag sailors at risk of mental health crises based on longitudinal stress data.
   - Enable proactive interventions, reducing risks of burnout or suicide.

## Future Directions

1. **Advanced Behavioral Models**:
   - Incorporate behavioral data (e.g., task completion time, error rates) into the stress model.

2. **Improved Scalability**:
   - Explore hardware acceleration (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson or Google Coral) for larger team simulations.

3. **Field Testing**:
   - Deploy the model in real-world scenarios (e.g., submarine crews, tactical operations) to validate its performance.

4. **Individualized Insights**:
   - Develop adaptive models that account for user-specific factors (e.g., age, fitness level, baseline variability).
